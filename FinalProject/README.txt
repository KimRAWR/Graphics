Final Project - Penguin Herding Simulator 2K15 / Midas Touch Penguin
=================================================================

Compile/Run:
   I've been using the 'make' command to build everything. Included are my related CMake and sources.txt files. 

User Instructions:
	The main controls are WASD to move around, with the touchpad scroll to look around. 
	The camera and all of the moving penguins are bound to the inside of the room.
	Penguins turn gold when you touch them (Midas touch).
	The console outputs how long it took to infect all the penguins, though takes a few seconds to display sometimes.
	Penguins like to mock you by moonwalking away from you sometimes. A 'feature,' not a bug. ;)



Have a cat. Because it's really late and I like cats.
