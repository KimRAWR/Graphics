Hi, Taylor/Zoe! 
I figured out something that was acting weird with my shaders, so I'm resubmitting this a day late to utilize one of my two free late days.

As I believe most other people have, to look around, I used the scroll glfw callback function.

I chose to make the camera's Y value fixed, so simulate how it would be if someone were running around on the ground. I'll hopefully do something with this for the final project.

Keypresses:
   For strafing and moving foward and back, you can just hold down one of the WASD keys to move around more quickly. Q and E move the light source back and forth.

Bugs:
   The main bug that I ran into and haven't been able to figure out is that the ground translates with the light source for some reason. So if you're moving the light around, and the ground slips out from under you, that's why.
