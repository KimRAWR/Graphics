Collision detection:
   [x] sphere around the center of the penguins, 
      - find distance between the two centers, add the radii,
        - if distance is greater than the radii added, not intersecting
   [x] detect when the camera touches a still penguin by sending out put to the
      console.
   [ ] move the penguins around randomly
   [ ] have them detect each other by means of epic fucking nested loops
      - when they collide, they can stop and change color? 
      - then make them slightly change directions (random left or right?)
